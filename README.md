## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

API is basicalling a set of rule that work together that help two or more programs/softwares to work together. APIs also allows systems to share data with each other .They also give developers access to already existing data, systems so that they improve their functions. An example of a project/scenario: Google Maaps API to provide me with an address or coordinates to an address that im looking for. API based my currect location will provide me the best rouyte based on distance and traffic. 

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

API is a set of rules and protocols that allow systems to communicate with one another.  Interface is a set of rules that must be followed or a common protocol that all these systems need to follow. Interface basically communicates how to they the rules to followed , while APIs follow the rules or enable the communicates or rules


3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

API components: ENDPOINTS,METHODS, DATA STRUCTURE, RATE LIMIT, ERROR HANDLING & AUTHORIZATION //
Endpoints- This is the URL that show APIs the entry points. they also show to what can be performed

Methods- communicates the rules or protocol to be performed on the resources

Data Structure- it specifies the form of the data being sent or being recieved 

Rate Limit- this limits misuse requests that can be made to the API in a given time 

Error Handling- to handle errors to the requesting software

Authentication- this ensures or verfies that the client that is requesting accessis entitled 

Error handling because it helps to handle any errors which will also help clients from misusing requests

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

I dont have much experince with APIs but curl tool is one of the most vitual APIs according to me because it transfers the data the web serve. Curl also works hand in hand with API librarie. These tools are very important because these tools ensure functuality and that API are efficient 

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

I would say know which APIs to use to ensure efficiency as also focusing or improving the security especially whn working with mutiple systems ensures that the data we have is secure
